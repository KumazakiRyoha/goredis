GoRedis is a Redis-like database implementation written in the Go programming language. This project aims to provide an efficient and easy-to-use in-memory database with a simple key-value store that supports various data structures and commands commonly used in Redis.

GoRedis is designed with high performance and scalability in mind, making it a suitable option for building modern, real-time applications. It supports multi-threading and concurrency, and it is built to handle a high volume of reads and writes.

Some of the features of GoRedis include support for string, list, hash, set, and sorted set data types, as well as commands for manipulating these data types, such as get, set, push, pop, and more. Additionally, GoRedis provides a command-line interface for interacting with the database, and it also includes support for persistent storage.

GoRedis is open-source and available on GitHub under the MIT License, allowing for contributions from the community to improve the project. The documentation is available in the repository's wiki, and the project welcomes feedback, bug reports, and feature requests from users.
